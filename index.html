        <p id="title-desc" class="center">
            Bruce Lee was an American and Hong Kong martial artist who gained global
            fame for his less rigid martial arts technique. Regarded by many as the
            greatest martial artist of all time, the San Francisco-born actor
            appeared in several critically acclaimed Hollywood and Hong Kong movies.
            In front of the screens, the charismatic young sage was the lead in
            several box office hits such as ‘Fists of Fury’ (1972) and Enter the
            Dragon (1972). As a martial arts instructor, Bruce Lee invented a
            martial arts fighting technique known as Jeet Kune Do, which translates
            into the Way of the Intercepting Fist.
